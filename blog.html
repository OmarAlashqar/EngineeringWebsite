      <div>
        <h1 style="color:#588C7E">Hour of Code</h1><br>
        <p>
          We kicked things off with an introduction into the world of computing.
          The <a href="https://code.org/learn" target="_blank">Hour of Code</a> initiative is
          designed to "demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics",
          and we took advantage of it. It taught us to think in code.<br><br>

          It goes over things such as basic commands and loops by utilizing code-blocks
          instead of actual lines of code. That way, anybody can start thinking like a
          computer scientist. Although it's a good place to start, I found that
          Hour of Code was too dull and not as challenging as it should be. This
          is probably due to the fact that it's meant to appeal to children.

        <p>
          After we got to play around with Hour of Code, we were directed to
          <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>. In essence,
          it's a programming sandbox. You can write simple applications, animate things,
          or even just play around until you think you've created something cool!<br><br>

          It makes use of the same code-block system as Hour of Code, but offers allows
          the user to do whatever he wants as opposed to solving a specific task.
          I didn't mess around with Scratch that much since I really wanted to get into
          the real deal, Python.

        <p>
          Ah, good ol' Python. For those of you who are new to the fabulous world
          of computers, <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/" target="_blank">Python</a>
          is an object-oriented, high-level programming language that's usually used in
          rapid application development.<br><br>

          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Code Academy</a> was
          a perfect place to start learning Python. It taught us everything there is
          to know about the language, all the way from basic arithmetic to creating and
          calling functions and even managing your own inventory! Unlike the preceding
          two websites, Code Academy actually got us dealing with real code.<br><br>

          We even got to test our Python skills in class! Me being who I am, I really
          enjoyed the challenges. For example, we were tasked to create a lottery numbers
          generator. As frustrating as it may have been, it ended up worked nicely.

  <!--Turtle-->

    <div id="blogText" style="background-color:#cd9dd0">
      <div>
        <h1 style="color:#8d5c8f">Turtle</h1><br>
        <p>
          Finally, we worked on Turtle. Basically, Turtle is a tool used to create
          graphics using lines and circles. It's as simple as it sounds. It's created
          on top of Python, so it has many of the same aspects. It runs by reading
          commands such as 'move forward' or 'turn right' and draws a line in its
          path.<br><br>

          In my opinion, this was the most intensely creative part of the unit since
          we were assigned the ultimate task of creating a winter wonderland scene
          using our knowledge in Turtle graphics. To the right, you can see my
          beautiful scene. It might not seem like it, but a picture like this would take
          weeks of determination and hard work to pull off!<br><br>

          All in all, I both enjoyed and despised spending my time on Turtle
          graphics. I must say, however, that working with it does develop
          a deeper understanding to what code can do. Who would've thought art
          can be coded?

    <div id="blogText" style="background-color:#9dd0bf">
      <div>
        <h1 style="color:#588C7E">Engineering Notation</h1><br>
        <p>
          In the engineering world, we tend to use Engineering Notation in order
          to express numbers that might be too big or too small in a more elegant manner.
          Essentially, it’s the same as Scientific Notation, which deals with a
          one digit number followed by a couple of decimals multiplied by 10 to the power
          of something.<br><br>

          In Engineering Notation, you are able to have up to a three digit number followed
          by a couple of decimals multiplied by 10 to the power of a multiple of three.
          Each multiple of three has its own SI prefix, as shown in the chart to the right.
          This makes it much easier to express values that might be too messy to deal with.<br><br>

          Most people already know some of these without realizing it. For example,
          a lot of people know that in a Gigabyte, there are 1000 Megabytes.

  <!--Series Circuits-->
  <div class="post">
    <div id="blogText" style="background-color:#a0d09d">
      <div>
        <h1 style="color:#598a57">Series Circuits</h1><br>
        <p>
          The first out of three types of circuits that we learned about was the
          Series circuit. You might've already dealt with these if you've taken
          a Physics course, and they're not any different at all.<br><br>

          All circuit include a power source, conductor wires, and a load. A
          Series Circuit is one that has all of its loads connected in such a way
          that the current has to flow through one path from and to the source.<br><br>

          According to Kirchhoff's Laws, the Current is the same throughout the circuit
          while the Voltages add up to the voltage of the source.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <br>

  <!--Parallel Circuits-->
  <div class="post">
    <div id="blogText" style="background-color:#d09d9f">
      <div>
        <h1 style="color:#975b5f">Parallel Circuits</h1><br>
        <p>
          A Parallel Circuit includes the same components of a Series Circuit,
          but differs in the way the loads are connected. In a Parallel Circuit,
          the loads are placed in separate pathways, branching off and merging back
          into the main path for the current. This can be seen to the right.<br><br>

          This allows for the Voltage to stay constant across all loads while the
          Current gets spread out across the loads.<br><br>

          Something to note is that since there are multiple pathways for the Current
          to flow through, this type of circuit is more reliable than a Series circuit
          since it would keep working even if one of the loads gets disconnected
          for whatever reason.

      <div>
        <h1 style="color:#8d5c8f">Series-Parallel Circuits</h1><br>
        <p>
          As the name suggests, the final type of circuits combines both aspects
          of a Series and Parallel circuits. This is the most widely used form out
          of all three since it can be customized to fit whatever task is required.<br><br>

          In retrospect this was probably the most annoying aspect of this whole course.
          To be fair, the math behind it might take a while to get used to, but isn’t
          too difficult. Mrs. Dorosz gave us a huge nine resistors circuit in which we had
          to find all values for every single resistor. This was probably her version of a
          cruel joke!<br><br>

          Another nice part of this unit was working with a couple of resources such as
          Edison and Multimedia Logic. These applications allowed us to create and even
          simulate our own circuits. It was a pretty cool as we got to play around with
          them.

        <p>
          To the right, we can observe a rather fabulous creature in its own habitat.
          The rare Finch Robot makes an appearance once in every decade! It's a
          plug and play robot that works by running code off of Python. We got to
          analyze a couple of preset codes and play around with it. Check out the
          video over at <br>
          <a href="memory.html" target="_blank">Memory Lane</a> for a demonstration of the
          Finch moving in a square-like fashion!<br><br>

          The Finch is equipped with multiple sensors, two wheels, an led nose, and a speaker!
          It's able to move around, avoid obstacles, and even produce music! This is
          an example where coding gets implemented into something we can actually observe.<br><br>

          I think it was a good idea working with the Finch as it made us relate
          computer code with physical devices. It's a nice sneak-peek into the
          mighty world of Computer Engineering.

        <h1 style="color:#588C7E">Numbering Systems</h1><br>
        <p>
          The most common Numbering System is base 10. We all count in base 10.
          However, other systems exist! Believe it or not, your computer actually
          functions on a base 2 numbering system, which consists of 0s and 1s.
          There are infinite possibilities for these systems, but the most common ones
          are Binary (base 2), Octadecimal (base 8), and Hexadecimal (base 16).<br><br>

          To be honest, I really loved learning how to read/write and even convert
          between these various numbering systems. I can now brag about being able
          to read binary! That's pretty awesome by itself!

        <h1 style="color:#598a57">Logic Gates</h1><br>
        <p>
          Ah, logic gates. They consist of gates... that are logical. Basically,
          logic gates take multiple binary inputs — where 1 is High and 0 is Low,
          and computes an output. They can be combined in many ways in order to
          create a result that you want.<br><br>

          On the right, you can see a list of all logic gates and their corresponding
          Truth Tables, which I'll explain later on.<br><br>

          Multiple logic gates are used in one system in order to create the desired
          result. Every diagram has a corresponding Boolean Equation.

  <!--Boolean Algebra-->

      <div>
        <h1 style="color:#975b5f">Boolean Algebra</h1><br>
        <p>
          Boolean Equations are set to equal a certain output. They go along
          Logic Diagrams. For an example, check out my solution for the<br>
          <a href="traffic.html">Traffic Light</a> logic system.<br><br>

          Boolean Equations can be simplified, just like you would in normal
          algebra. There are a set of rules, including the laws and Demorgan's Law,
          that help in the process of simplification. To the right, you can see an
          example of a Boolean Equation being simplified.<br><br>

      <div>
        <h1 style="color:#8d5c8f">Truth Tables</h1><br>
        <p>
          These nifty tables come in handy when it gets to displaying outputs
          in an orderly fashion. Basically, you have your inputs, each in a
          separate column. Under that, you have every possible input. To the right
          of those, you have your outputs.<br><br>

          This is very useful when it gets to creating a Boolean Equation to go along
          with your scenario. Also, you can create them by using your existing Boolean
          Equation in order to debug or simplify.<br><br>

          I believe that all these aspects of Digital Circuits are necessary
          in order to solve problems such as the <a href="traffic.html">Traffic Light</a>
          problem, which you can check in case you haven't!

        <p>
          We also learned other ways to simplify Boolean Equations. What I believe
          is the easiest, cleanest method of doing so is by using K-Maps.
          Better known as Karnaugh Maps, these tables make simplify the process
          of simplification!<br><br>

          Instead of doing it algebraically, it helps you visualize and simplify
          without having to deal with any laws or theorems. To the right is an
          example of simplification by K-Mapping.

          Ah, the important part! How does all of this unit apply into real life?
          Easy. Think of any device that requires circuits to work. That device
          wouldn't function the way it does without Logic Gates! If you want a
          more specific example, check out my explanation on the<br>
          <a href="traffic.html">Traffic Light</a> logic system!<br><br>

          By simplifying logic systems, you can effectively reduce the cost of manufacturing,
          decrease size, and increase efficiency of any given machine or device!
          In today's modern world, this is very important as society is shifting to
          a state where everybody relies heavily on their personal devices.

          HTML, or Hyper-Text Markup Language, is a Markup Language for browsers.
          Basically, HTML is a way of formatting words with special tags and
          attributes in a certain method such that your web browser can understand
          and display a website the way it's supposed to be displayed.<br><br>

          HTML5 is the latest version, and is the basic type of web development.
          Usually, developers make use of frameworks such as JQuery or BootStrap
          in order to make things a little easier for themselves.<br><br>

          In case you were wondering, this website was created using HTML and CSS!

          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Essentially, they are files that
          accompany a html website. They contain code that "beautifies" websites.
          They include background colours, font sizes, etc.<br><br>

          Although you can style elements within a HTML file, using a separate
          CSS file is much more efficient since you can edit that file and it
          would affect every single HTML file that is linked to it. To the right,
          you can see an example of a website that utilizes CSS.<br><br>
